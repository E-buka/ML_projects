# ML_projects
This repository contains projects on supervised and unsupervised learning
The projects are:

### Garment porduction productivity prediction
Using decision tree classifier, I modelled the productivity of workers in a garment factory. The model was able to identify the biggest motivators for high  productivity among workers. The model performance was evaluated by cross validation and also the performance of the decision tree was compared against randomforest classifier.

### Credit card customer segmentation
In this model, different group of customers were segmented into five clusters for business marketing using KMeans clustering. The distintive features of each cluster group was explored using EDA. 

### Gym crowdedness prediction 
Using the data from a gym, I employed SGD regressor to predict the best time to go the school gym facility. The project also includes some EDA of the school gym facility. 

### Heart disease prediction and classification
Using patients' data on heart disease, i employed k neighbor classifier to prediction whether patients are at risk of heart disease. In the classification section, logistic regression was used to classifier patients as positive for heart disease. The logistic model compared the performance of different predictors for patient classification.

### Insurance cost prediction
Using a data from customer health insurance and linear regression model, i tried to predict the health insurance costs of customers in this project. 

### Forest fire damage prediction
Finally, in this project, i compared different linear models (linear regression, LASSO, combination of predictors, polynomial, spline) performances for the prediction of forest fire damage. The best performing model was selected and evaluated by cross validation. 

### Conclusion
In this set of projects, I have used different machine learning models to predict/classifier data from various sources. In some cases,  the model were robust enough in their performance while in others, it showed that not all cases can be fit easily through machine learning algorithms.
